# Human Design API

Welcome to the Human Design API! This project provides a robust and scalable API for calculating various Human Design features based on birth data. Built with FastAPI and leveraging powerful astrological and geographical libraries, it offers a comprehensive solution for integrating Human Design analytics into your applications.

## Project Overview
 
The **Human Design API** is a high-performance Python service meant to power modern Human Design applications. It serves as a comprehensive backend engine that:

1.   **Calculates** core and deep Human Design metrics from birth data (Earth, Moon, Nodes, Planets, Gates, Lines, Color, Tone, Base).
2.  **Resolves** birth locations to precise geocoordinates and timezones automatically.
3.  **Visualizes** results by generating beautiful, high-quality BodyGraph images on-the-fly.

Whether you are building a mobile app, a professional dashboard, or a personal research tool, this API provides the rigorous astrological data and visual assets you need, all containerized for easy deployment.

### Key Features:

*   **FastAPI Backend**: High-performance, async-ready Python web framework.
*   **Precise Calculations**: Uses `pyswisseph` for Swiss Ephemeris accuracy and `geopy`/`timezonefinder` for reliable location and timezone resolution.
*   **BodyGraph Visualization**: Generates high-fidelity, transparent BodyGraph charts in PNG, SVG, and JPG formats via the `/bodygraph` endpoint.
*   **Composite Analysis**: Calculates relationship mechanics (connection channels, centers) between multiple people via the `/compmatrix` endpoint.
*   **Detailed Pairwise Analysis**: Calculates granular relationship details (new/duplicated channels) for exactly two people via the `/analyze/composite` endpoint.
*   **Transit Analysis**: Provides Daily Weather and Solar Return (Yearly Theme) calculations for advanced forecasting.
*   **Penta Analysis**: Calculates Group Dynamics (3-5 people) via the `/analyze/penta` endpoint, revealing active group energy fields.
*   **Comprehensive Chart Data**: Returns Energy Type, Strategy, Authority, Profile, Incarnation Cross, Variables, Age, Western Zodiac Sign, and full Planetary/Gate positions.
*   **Robust Validation**: Strict input validation using Pydantic, supporting flexible data types (integers or strings) for ease of integration.
*   **Docker Ready**: Simple deployment with Docker and Docker Compose.
*   **OpenAPI Specification**: Fully documented API with `openapi.yaml` and interactive Swagger UI.
*   **Authentication**: Secure access via Bearer token.

## Installation and Setup

To get the Human Design API up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
*   **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is usually bundled with Docker Desktop. Verify its installation by running `docker-compose --version` in your terminal.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/humandesign_api.git
    cd humandesign_api
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env_example` file. This file will store your API token.

    ```
    HD_API_TOKEN=your_secret_token_here
    ```
    Replace `your_secret_token_here` with a strong, unique token.

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**:
    Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    *   `--build`: This flag tells Docker Compose to build the images before starting containers. This is necessary for the first run or after any changes to the `Dockerfile` or `requirements.txt`.
    *   `-d`: This flag runs the containers in detached mode, meaning they will run in the background.

4.  **Verify Installation**:
    Once the containers are up, the API should be accessible at `http://localhost:9021`. You can verify its status by checking your Docker Desktop dashboard or by running:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    You should see a container named `humandesignapi` running.
