# Human Design API

Welcome to the Human Design API! This project provides a robust and scalable API for calculating various Human Design features based on birth data. Built with FastAPI and leveraging powerful astrological and geographical libraries, it offers a comprehensive solution for integrating Human Design analytics into your applications.

## Project Overview

The Human Design API is a Python-based service designed to compute intricate Human Design charts. It takes birth details (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and place) as input and returns a detailed JSON response including energy type, inner authority, incarnation cross, profile, active/inactive chakras, split definition, and planetary gate information.

The API is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent and isolated environments for development and deployment. Docker Compose is used for easy orchestration of the API service.

### Key Features:

*   **FastAPI Backend**: High-performance Python web framework for building APIs.
*   **Human Design Calculations**: Utilizes `pyswisseph` for precise astrological calculations and `geopy` for geocoding and timezone determination.
*   **Comprehensive Output**: Provides detailed Human Design chart information, including energy type, inner authority, incarnation cross, profile, active/inactive chakras, split definition, and planetary gate data.
*   **Dockerized Deployment**: Easy to set up and deploy using Docker and Docker Compose.
*   **Authentication**: API token-based authentication for secure access.

## Installation and Setup

To get the Human Design API up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
*   **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is usually bundled with Docker Desktop. Verify its installation by running `docker-compose --version` in your terminal.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/humandesign_v1.git
    cd humandesign_v1
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env_example` file. This file will store your API token.

    ```
    HD_API_TOKEN=your_secret_token_here
    ```
    Replace `your_secret_token_here` with a strong, unique token.

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**:
    Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    *   `--build`: This flag tells Docker Compose to build the images before starting containers. This is necessary for the first run or after any changes to the `Dockerfile` or `requirements.txt`.
    *   `-d`: This flag runs the containers in detached mode, meaning they will run in the background.

4.  **Verify Installation**:
    Once the containers are up, the API should be accessible at `http://localhost:9021`. You can verify its status by checking your Docker Desktop dashboard or by running:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    You should see a container named `humandesignapi` running.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```

```

*   **`api.py`**: The main FastAPI application. It defines the API endpoints, handles request parsing, calls the Human Design calculation logic, and formats the response.
*   **`convertJSON.py`**: Contains utility functions for converting raw Human Design calculation results into a structured JSON format for the API response. It also includes helper functions for mapping incarnation crosses, profiles, and channels to their descriptive names.
*   **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the Docker image for the API, specifying the base Python image, dependencies, and application setup.
*   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Orchestrates the Docker containers, defining the `humandesign-api` service, port mappings, and environment variables.
*   **`geocode.py`**: Provides functions for geocoding (converting place names to latitude and longitude) and reverse geocoding, used to determine the correct timezone for birth locations.
*   **`hd_constants.py`**: Stores all the constant values, mappings, and databases required for Human Design calculations, such as planetary codes, I Ging circle, chakra definitions, incarnation cross types, profile names, and channel meanings.
*   **`hd_features.py`**: Contains the core logic for Human Design calculations. This includes functions for converting timestamps to Julian dates, calculating creation dates, mapping planetary positions to gates, lines, colors, tones, and bases, and determining energy types, inner authorities, incarnation crosses, profiles, active chakras, and splits.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required by the project.
*   **`LICENSE`**: The license file for the project.
*   **`README.mdx`**: This markdown file, providing an overview, setup instructions, and documentation for the project.
*   **`.env_example`**: An example file for environment variables, specifically for the `HD_API_TOKEN`.
*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   **`static/`**: Directory for static assets, currently containing `favicon.ico`.

## API Usage

The Human Design API provides a single endpoint for calculating Human Design features.

### `GET /calculate`

Calculates Human Design features based on birth information.

#### Parameters

## API Documentation

The project includes an OpenAPI 3.0 specification file named `openapi.yaml`. This file describes the API endpoints, request parameters, responses, and schemas in a standard format.

### Using `openapi.yaml`

You can use the `openapi.yaml` file to:

1.  **Visualize the API**:
    *   **VS Code**: Install extensions like "Swagger Viewer" or "OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor" to preview the API documentation directly in your editor.
    *   **Online Viewers**: Copy the content of `openapi.yaml` and paste it into the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to view and interact with the API documentation.

2.  **Import into Postman**:
    *   Open Postman.
    *   Click on the **Import** button in the top left corner.
    *   Drag and drop the `openapi.yaml` file or select it from your file system.
    *   Postman will automatically generate a collection with the request (including examples) pre-configured.

3.  **Generate Client Libraries**:
    *   Tools like `openapi-generator` can use this file to generate API client code for various programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
