## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-19
### Added
- **Penta Analysis V2**: New endpoint `POST /analyze/penta/v2`.
    - **Sovereign Standard**: Consultant-grade interpretation with zero hallucinations.
    - **Contextual Semantics**: API dynamically adjusts output language for "Business" vs "Family" group types (e.g., "Toxic Environment" vs "Chaotic Home").
    - **Functional Role Assignment**: Explicitly maps contributors to functional roles (e.g., `"Planning": ["User A"]`).
    - **Operational Style (Line Semantics)**: Interprets the *style* of contribution based on line data (e.g., "Line 1: Authoritarian", "Line 6: Administrator").
    - **Gap Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of missing gates/skills with severity (Critical/Moderate) and impact descriptions.
    - **Advanced Metrics**: Includes Stability Score, Vision vs Action Score, and Backbone Integrity checks.

### Changed
- **HD Constants**: Added extensive semantic maps (`FAMILY_SKILLS_MAP`, `FAMILY_SHADOW_MAP`, `PENTA_LINE_KEYWORD_MAP`) to support V2 logic.
- **Core Features**: Refactored `get_penta_v2` in `core.py` to implement the new Diamond/Sovereign standards.


## [1.9.1] - 2026-01-19
### Changed
- **Solar Return Parity**: Standardized `/transits/solar_return` output to match `/transits/daily`. Use the return structure `meta`, `composite_changes`, `planetary_transits`.
- **Metadata**: Enhanced Solar Return metadata to include full chart details (Profile, Cross, Channels, etc.) using `enrich_transit_metadata`.
- **Documentation**: Updated `sr_year_offset` to explicitly state `0` = Birth Year, `X` = Current/Future Year.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-18
### Added
- **Location-Aware Transits**: Added `current_place` parameter to `/transits/daily` to calculate planetary positions based on the user's current location (timezone).
- **Custom Transit Timing**: Added `transit_hour` and `transit_minute` parameters to specify the exact time of analysis (defaults to 12:00 Local Time).
- **Metadata**: Response `meta` now includes `calculation_place`, `transit_date_local`, and `transit_date_utc`.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-01-18
### Added
- **Enriched Metadata**: The `/transits/daily` endpoint now includes a comprehensive `meta` object with:
    - **Bio**: Age, Place, Gender, IsAlive.
    - **Astrology**: Zodiac Sign.
    - **HD Core**: Energy Type, Strategy, Signature, Not-Self, Aura, Inner Authority, Profile, Incarnation Cross.
    - **Mechanics**: Defined/Undefined Centers, Definition Type.
    - **Channels**: List of formatted active channels (e.g., `6/59: The Channel of Mating (Reproduction)`).
### Changed
- **API Defaults**: Updated default query parameters for `/transits/daily` to `1968-02-21 11:00` (Kirikkale, Turkey) and `2025-01-10`.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-18

    - **Meta**: Includes explicit Type, Authority, and Transit Date (Local/UTC).
    - **Composite Changes**: Lists exactly which Channels and Centers are defined *by the transit connection*.
    - **Planetary Transits**: Detailed breakdown of current planetary positions (Gate, Line, Color, Tone, Base).
- **Metadata Enums**: Updated `hd_constants.py` with formalized `INNER_AUTHORITY_NAMES_MAP` (e.g., "Ego-Manifested Authority", "No Inner Authority").

### Changed
- **Enhanced Authority Logic**: Refactored `get_auth` in `mechanics.py` to strictly follow the standard Authority Hierarchy:
    1. **Emotional** (Solar Plexus)
    2. **Sacral** (Sacral)
    3. **Splenic** (Spleen)
    4. **Ego** (Heart: Manifested or Projected)
    5. **Self-Projected** (G-Center)
    6. **Outer/Lunar** (No Inner Authority)
- **Authority Mapping**: Updated `INNER_AUTHORITY_NAMES_MAP` in `hd_constants.py` to provide detailed authority names (e.g., "Solar Plexus, Emotional", "Heart & G Center, Ego Projected").


## [1.7.3] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Variable Shorthand**: Added `short_code` field to the `variables` response object (e.g., "PRL DRR") to standardize arrow direction summary.


## [1.7.2] - 2026-01-13

### Changed
- Refactored `general` response structure to group demographics (`age`, `gender`, `islive`) and astrological info (`zodiac_sign`) immediate after the birth place.

### Refactored
- **Variables Logic**: Migrated `variables.json` data into internal `hd_constants.py` to remove external file dependencies and improve performance.
- **Project Structure**: Standardized variable keys across the codebase (e.g., `top_left` instead of `right_up`) for better readability and alignment with Human Design terminology. See [Track: Refactor Variables](conductor/tracks/refactor_variables_20260103/) for details.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Variables**: Resolved an issue where the `variables` (arrows) field in the API response was hardcoded. The output now correctly reflects dynamic calculations based on planetary tones.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **System Health**: Implemented a new `GET /health` endpoint for operational monitoring.
- **Architecture**: Created a centralized version extraction utility in `src/humandesign/utils/version.py` that reads directly from `pyproject.toml`.

- **Testing**: Added comprehensive test suites for health endpoints, schemas, and versioning logic.

## [1.5.1] - 2025-12-30

### Added
- **Features**: Added `age` and `zodiac_sign` fields to the `/calculate` response.
- **Input**: Added optional `gender` and `islive` query parameters to `/calculate` and corresponding Pydantic schemas.
- **Utilities**: Implemented `astrology` utility for Western zodiac calculation and `calculate_age` helper.
- **Compatibility**: Upgraded `fastapi` and `pydantic` versions to resolve environment-specific dependency conflicts (Starlette/HTTPX).
- **Usability**: Set default values for `/calculate` (1968 birth data) to pre-fill Swagger UI for easier testing.

### Changed
- **Formatting**: Updated `/calculate` output to return expanded profile names (e.g., "4/6: Opportunist Role Model") instead of raw numbers.
- **Documentation**: Clarified `islive` parameter to indicate life status (True = Alive, False = Deceased).
- **Defaults**: Updated default values for `gender` (`male`) and `islive` (`true`) across all schemas and endpoints.
- **Refactoring**: Replaced deprecated `example` parameter with the modern `examples` list in all route definitions to eliminate `FastAPIDeprecationWarning`.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-23

### Added
