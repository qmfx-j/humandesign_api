Reduced our Docker image size from 588 MB to 47.7 MB.

Original build:
- Full Python 3.9 base image
- Multiple RUN instructions creating excess layers
- No .dockerignore file
- Single stage build with all dependencies

Optimizations applied:
1. Lightweight base image
- Switched to Python 3.9-alpine
- 95% smaller and faster to pull

2. Layer optimization
- Combined related commands
- Reduced redundant RUN instructions

3. .dockerignore file
- Excluded venv, cache, and temp files
- Reduced build context

4. Multi stage builds
- Build stage with dependencies
- Production stage with only required runtime files

Results:
- Image size: 47.7 MB (down from 588 MB)
- Size reduction: −91.89%
- Faster container startup
- Reduced deployment time and storage usage

Small optimizations compound. Every MB saved accelerates every build.
